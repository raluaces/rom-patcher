## About

This tool allows you to copy download URL's from SMW Central (and some other platforms) and paste it into the source box; and will download the remote resource, unarchive it, and patch it with 1 click of a button.

## Usage

1. Find a ROM Hack from SMW Central and copy the download link. It also may work with the URL from your address bar but is guaranteed to work with the download link. You may also specify an already downloaded patch file or zip containing an patch file. This goes in the first box.

Example: https://dl.smwcentral.net/17289/GPW1.2.zip

2. This is the location to the source SMW ROM to apply the patch too. This file will not be modified, a new output file will be created in the directory specified below.

Example: C:/Users/Shane/ROMS/Super Mario World (USA).sfc

3. The output directory where the new patched ROM file (romhack) will appear.

Example: (anywhere you want, maybe the desktop?)

4. Click "Patch ROM". The final rom location will display in the status box and you can click open directory to find it.

## Building

You will need the required `bin` directory with flips for your OS.

#### Windows

Install the requirements.txt plus pyinstaller then build with:
```
powershell.exe .\scripts\build.ps1
```

After building you can create an installer with inno setup by running:
```
ISCC.exe rom-patcher.iss
```

- `bin`: https://jenkins.imgg.site/static/rom-patcher-gui/bin.zip

#### Linux

Install the requirements.txt plus pyinstaller then build with:  
```
bash scripts/build.sh
```

- `bin`: https://jenkins.imgg.site/static/rom-patcher-gui/bin-linux.zip

#### macOS

This app currently does **not** function on macOS due to missing `flips` binary; otherwise will compile just fine.

If anyone wants to write working python code for bps and ips that would be amazing!
